# 📌 MattersUrSkill

MattersUrSkill is a university mini project based on the MERN stack concept, aimed at reducing unemployment caused by limited access to skill-based work opportunities.

The platform focuses on connecting students, housewives, unemployed, and less-educated individuals with genuine work opportunities such as home-based work, part-time tasks, and local services.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Many students, housewives, and unemployed individuals lack opportunities to earn money due to time constraints, limited access, or the absence of trusted platforms. At the same time, individuals and businesses struggle to find reliable workers for tasks ranging from home-based work to local services.

This gap results in unemployment, dependency on middlemen, and underutilization of practical skills.

## 🎯 Objectives

- To provide a trusted digital platform for skill-based work opportunities  
- To empower students, housewives, and unemployed individuals through flexible work options  
- To connect workers and work providers directly without middlemen  
- To support home-based and local service employment  
- To promote skill recognition over formal education

## 🛠️ Proposed Solution

MattersUrSkill is designed as a MERN stack–based web platform that connects people who need work done with individuals willing to work based on their skills, availability, and location.

Workers can list their skills such as home-based work, part-time tasks, or local services, while work providers can post tasks with details like location, duration, and payment. The platform aims to ensure trust through verification and transparency through ratings and feedback.
